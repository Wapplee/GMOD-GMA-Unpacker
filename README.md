# GMOD-GMA-Unpacker
Allows you to have more than 2048 lua files!!

This is a project I decided to take on because i was annoyed of the fact that my 1000 nextbots werent showing up on the spawnmenu, and one thing came to mind: LUA FILE LIMIT!
This URL (https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod-issues/issues/1058) taught me that there is a lua file limit, and since I suck at using .bat files, i decided to use everyone's favorite school cheating companion.

## I do not mind if you use this anywhere, thats why it is unlicensed, but at least give credit to me. It is very simple to do, everything is shown.


you are using this at your own risk, i did not experiment this thoroughly, at this time right now it unpacks everything into /garrysmod.
